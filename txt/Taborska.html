          />The Contemporary Literary and Artistic Culture Unit was established
          in 2007 as part of the activities of the Institute of European Culture
          at Polish University Abroad in London (PUNO). It was established in
          response to the growing need to examine the whole range of artistic
          and cultural structures created in exile in the context of their
          dialogue with European and world aesthetics. It carries out a
          programme of particular cognitive and cultural value, equipping PUNO's
          students with knowledge related to Polish cultural tradition
          (including literary and artistic tradition). Apart from individual
          research, the Unit's employees often carry out their own artistic
          activities, fitting in with the landscape of their analyses. Among the
          leading themes is the search for thematic and aesthetic links between
          Polish artists (musicians, writers, visual artists, filmmakers, etc.)
          and anthropological threads known in the culture of various nations.

          The research reflection includes topics on the border of semiotics of
          culture, art history, music studies, literature studies, interpersonal
          communication and the anthropology of new media. Academic teachers,
          who constitute the scientific and didactic staff of the Unit, conduct
          classes, among others, as part of the Course of Polish Culture,
          activities of the University of the Third Age, open lectures, prepare
          conference and inaugural lectures and occasional laudations. The
          Unit's activities also include post-graduate studies for teachers of
          Polish language and culture outside Poland. These Studies are
          organized by the Polish Educational Society, University of Lodz and
          PUNO.<img

          The Unit also offers various workshops and academic courses in the
          field of artistic culture. There is also a Laboratory of
          Lingua-Branding, which deals with interdisciplinary research on human
          behaviour in the network in terms of the influence of audiovisual
          language with respect to cultural differences.
